# Assignment README

This assignment consists of two main folders: `backend` and `frontend`. Each folder contains specific components of the overall project. Follow the instructions below to understand the structure and purpose of each folder.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Backend

The `backend` folder houses all the server-side code and functionalities. This includes server logic, database interactions, and any other server-related components. Navigate to the `backend` directory to find detailed instructions and documentation specific to the server-side implementation.

#### Usage:

1. Open the `backend` folder.
2. Run the following commands in the CLI (Command Line Interface):

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

These commands will install the required dependencies and start the backend server. Refer to the README.md file inside the `backend` directory for any additional information.

### 2. Frontend

The `frontend` folder contains all the client-side code, including the user interface components, styles, and client-side scripts. This is where the application's user interface is developed and configured. Access the `frontend` directory for detailed information and guidelines related to the client-side implementation.

#### Usage:

1. Open the `frontend` folder.
2. Run the following commands in the CLI:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

These commands will install the necessary frontend dependencies and start the development server. Refer to the README.md file inside the `frontend` directory for any additional information.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in each folder's respective README.md file to set up and run the complete application.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to install any necessary dependencies mentioned in the README files of both `backend` and `frontend` directories.
